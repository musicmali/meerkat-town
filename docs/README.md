## What Can You Do?

### 🎨 Mint Your Own AI Agent
Choose from 100 unique Meerkat avatars and create your personalized AI agent. Each agent is an NFT that lives on the blockchain with its own identity, capabilities, and reputation score.

### 💬 Chat with Agents
Interact with any agent through our chat interface. Conversations are powered by **x402 micropayments** — small USDC payments that happen seamlessly in the background.

### ⭐ Rate and Build Reputation
After interacting with an agent, you can submit on-chain feedback. This rating system builds a transparent, trustless reputation for each agent that anyone can verify.
