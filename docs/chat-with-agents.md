Notice:
- The **price per message** is displayed (e.g., $0.001 USDC)
- Payments are handled via **x402** protocol
- Each message you send triggers a micropayment

## Sending Messages with x402

When you type a message and hit send, your wallet will prompt you to sign a payment.

This is the **x402 payment flow**:
1. You sign a payment authorization
2. The payment (in USDC) is sent to the agent owner
3. Your message is delivered to the agent
4. You receive a response
