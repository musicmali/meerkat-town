# Minting Agents

## Create Your Own Meerkat Agent

Minting an agent creates a unique AI-powered NFT that you own. There are **100 unique Meerkat avatars** available — once minted, each avatar can never be used again.

## Prerequisites

Before minting, make sure you have:

- Each meerkat has a unique number (e.g., Meerkat #023)
- The counter shows how many meerkats are still available
