# Astronomy and Space

Astronomy is the scientific study of celestial objects, space, and the universe as a whole. From the planets in our solar system to distant galaxies, space exploration and discovery continue to push the boundaries of human knowledge.

## The Solar System

### The Sun
- A medium-sized star (G-type main-sequence, or yellow dwarf)
- Age: ~4.6 billion years, with ~5 billion years of fuel remaining
- Diameter: ~1.4 million km (109x Earth's diameter)
- Composed primarily of hydrogen (~73%) and helium (~25%)
- Energy produced by nuclear fusion (hydrogen → helium) in the core
- Surface temperature: ~5,500°C; core temperature: ~15 million°C

### Terrestrial Planets (Inner)
- **Mercury**: closest to Sun, no atmosphere, extreme temperature swings (-180°C to 430°C)
- **Venus**: hottest planet (462°C surface), thick CO2 atmosphere, runaway greenhouse effect
- **Earth**: only known planet with liquid water and life, protective magnetic field
- **Mars**: thin atmosphere, evidence of past water, target for human colonization

### Gas and Ice Giants (Outer)
- **Jupiter**: largest planet, Great Red Spot storm, 95 known moons (Io, Europa, Ganymede, Callisto)
- **Saturn**: famous ring system (ice and rock particles), 146 known moons (Titan has lakes of methane)
- **Uranus**: tilted 98° on its axis, methane atmosphere gives blue-green color, 28 moons
- **Neptune**: strongest winds in the solar system (2,100 km/h), 16 known moons (Triton)

### Other Objects
- **Dwarf planets**: Pluto, Eris, Ceres, Makemake, Haumea
- **Asteroid belt**: between Mars and Jupiter (millions of rocky bodies)
- **Kuiper Belt**: beyond Neptune (icy bodies including Pluto)
- **Oort Cloud**: hypothesized shell of icy objects, source of long-period comets
- **Comets**: icy bodies that develop tails when approaching the Sun

## Stellar Classification

### Star Types (Spectral Classes)
- **O**: blue, hottest (>30,000K), massive, short-lived (rare)
- **B**: blue-white, very hot, luminous (Rigel)
- **A**: white, hot (Sirius, Vega)
- **F**: yellow-white (Canopus, Procyon)
- **G**: yellow, like our Sun (5,200-6,000K)
- **K**: orange, cooler (Arcturus, Alpha Centauri B)
- **M**: red, coolest, most common (Proxima Centauri, Betelgeuse)
- Mnemonic: "Oh Be A Fine Girl/Guy, Kiss Me"

### Stellar Life Cycle
1. **Nebula**: cloud of gas and dust collapses under gravity
2. **Protostar**: core heats up, not yet fusing hydrogen
3. **Main sequence**: stable hydrogen fusion (where stars spend most of their life)
4. **Red giant/supergiant**: core hydrogen exhausted, outer layers expand
5. **End state depends on mass**:
   - Low mass → white dwarf → black dwarf (eventually)
   - Medium mass → neutron star (often a pulsar)
   - High mass → supernova → black hole

### Special Objects
- **White dwarfs**: dead star cores, Earth-sized but Sun-mass
- **Neutron stars**: incredibly dense, a teaspoon weighs billions of tons
- **Pulsars**: rapidly spinning neutron stars emitting beams of radiation
- **Black holes**: gravity so strong that nothing, not even light, can escape
- **Magnetars**: neutron stars with extremely strong magnetic fields

## Exoplanets

### What Are Exoplanets?
- Planets orbiting stars other than our Sun
- Over 5,600 confirmed exoplanets discovered (as of 2024)
- Kepler Space Telescope discovered the most (2,700+)
- TESS (Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite) now leading discovery

### Detection Methods
- **Transit method**: planet passes in front of star, dimming its light
- **Radial velocity**: star wobbles due to planet's gravitational pull
- **Direct imaging**: photograph the planet (very difficult, requires blocking starlight)
- **Gravitational microlensing**: planet's gravity bends light from background star
- Transit method is most successful (Kepler, TESS)

### Notable Exoplanets
- **Proxima Centauri b**: nearest exoplanet to Earth (4.2 light-years)
- **TRAPPIST-1 system**: 7 Earth-sized planets, 3 in habitable zone
- **Kepler-452b**: "Earth's cousin," similar size and orbit to Earth
- **Hot Jupiters**: gas giants orbiting very close to their stars
- **Super-Earths**: rocky planets larger than Earth but smaller than Neptune

### The Habitable Zone
- "Goldilocks zone": distance from star where liquid water could exist
- Too close = too hot (water evaporates), too far = too cold (water freezes)
- Depends on star type (dimmer stars have closer habitable zones)
- Habitable zone ≠ habitable (atmosphere, magnetic field, and other factors matter)
