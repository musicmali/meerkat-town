# Cognitive Biases and Decision Psychology

Understanding cognitive biases and psychological patterns is essential for making better decisions, especially in high-stakes areas like investing, trading, and risk assessment. Our brains use mental shortcuts (heuristics) that are often useful but can lead to systematic errors in judgment.

## Cognitive Biases

### Confirmation Bias
- Tendency to seek, interpret, and remember information that confirms existing beliefs
- Ignore or dismiss evidence that contradicts your view
- Especially dangerous in investing: only reading bullish analysis when you're long
- Mitigation: actively seek opposing viewpoints, steelman the counter-argument

### Anchoring Bias
- Over-relying on the first piece of information encountered
- "It was $100 before, so $50 is cheap" (the previous price anchors your judgment)
- Common in negotiations and price assessments
- Mitigation: consider multiple reference points, evaluate on current fundamentals

### Availability Bias
- Judging probability based on how easily examples come to mind
- Recent, vivid, or emotional events seem more likely than they are
- Media coverage amplifies this effect (shark attacks seem common, car accidents don't)
- Mitigation: use data and base rates instead of anecdotes

### Survivorship Bias
- Focusing on winners and ignoring failures
- "Look at all these successful crypto investors" (ignoring the many who lost money)
- Leads to overestimating chances of success
- Mitigation: ask "Where are the ones that failed?" and include them in your analysis

### Hindsight Bias
- "I knew it all along" after an event occurs
- Makes past events seem predictable and obvious
- Leads to overconfidence in predicting future events
- Mitigation: keep a decision journal to track what you actually thought at the time

### Dunning-Kruger Effect
- Low-skilled individuals overestimate their ability
- Highly skilled individuals often underestimate their relative competence
- Beginners are often the most confident
- Mitigation: seek feedback, remain humble, test your knowledge

### Recency Bias
- Giving more weight to recent events than older ones
- A few good trades can create false confidence
- Recent market direction feels like it will continue forever
- Mitigation: zoom out to longer time horizons, use historical data

### Bandwagon Effect
- Following the crowd without independent analysis
- "Everyone is buying, so it must be good"
- Drives bubbles and panic selling
- Mitigation: develop your own thesis, be skeptical of consensus

## Emotional Biases in Investing

### FOMO (Fear of Missing Out)
- Buying because others are profiting, not because of fundamentals
- Often leads to buying at the top of a rally
- Social media amplifies FOMO with highlight reels of gains
- Mitigation: have a plan before the opportunity arises, stick to criteria

### Loss Aversion
- Losses feel roughly 2x more painful than equivalent gains feel good
- Leads to holding losing positions too long ("it'll come back")
- And selling winners too early (to lock in the good feeling)
- Mitigation: set stop-losses before entering trades, evaluate positions objectively

### Sunk Cost Fallacy
- Continuing an action because of past investment (time, money, effort)
- "I've already lost $5,000, I can't sell now"
- Past costs are irrelevant to future decisions
- Mitigation: ask "If I didn't own this, would I buy it today at this price?"

### Overconfidence
- Overestimating your knowledge, predictions, or ability
- Leads to excessive risk-taking and under-diversification
- Particularly strong after a streak of successful trades
- Mitigation: track your actual hit rate, size positions conservatively

### Herd Mentality
- Following the crowd because it feels safer
- "If everyone's doing it, it can't be wrong" (but it often is)
- Drives market bubbles and crashes
- Mitigation: think contrarian, ask what happens if the crowd is wrong

### Endowment Effect
- Overvaluing things simply because you own them
- "My NFT is worth more than the floor price"
- Makes it hard to sell or reallocate objectively
- Mitigation: regularly ask if you'd buy the same position at current prices

### Status Quo Bias
- Preference for the current state of affairs
- Resistance to changing portfolio allocation or strategy
- Inaction can be as costly as wrong action
- Mitigation: schedule regular portfolio reviews, set rebalancing rules

## Decision-Making Frameworks

### Expected Value Analysis
- Calculate: probability of outcome x value of outcome
- Sum all possible outcomes for total expected value
- Positive EV decisions are worth making over time
- Account for all scenarios, not just the best case
- Useful for evaluating trades, investments, and business decisions

### Pre-Mortem Analysis
- Before a decision, imagine it has failed spectacularly
- Ask: "What went wrong?" and work backwards
- Identifies risks you might have overlooked
- Reduces overconfidence and improves planning
- Team exercise: everyone independently lists failure modes

### Inversion
- Instead of asking "How do I succeed?", ask "How could I fail?"
- Avoid the causes of failure, and success becomes more likely
- Charlie Munger: "Tell me where I'm going to die, and I'll never go there"
- Useful for risk assessment and portfolio construction

### Second-Order Thinking
- First-order: "What happens immediately?"
- Second-order: "And then what happens after that?"
- Most people stop at first-order effects
- Example: "If this token pumps, everyone will ape in, creating a top"
- Thinking in consequences of consequences leads to better decisions

### Decision Matrix
- List options as rows, criteria as columns
- Weight criteria by importance
- Score each option on each criterion
- Calculate weighted totals
- Forces structured evaluation instead of gut feeling

## Logical Fallacies

### Ad Hominem
- Attacking the person instead of their argument
- "He's a known bear, so his analysis is wrong"
- An argument's merit is independent of who makes it

### Straw Man
- Misrepresenting someone's argument to make it easier to attack
- Arguing against a weaker version of the actual position
- Address the strongest form of opposing arguments

### False Dichotomy
- Presenting only two options when more exist
- "Either Bitcoin goes to $1M or it goes to zero"
- Reality usually has more nuanced outcomes

### Appeal to Authority
- "This famous person said it, so it must be true"
- Experts can be wrong, especially outside their domain
- Evaluate the argument, not just the source

### Correlation vs Causation
- Two things happening together doesn't mean one causes the other
- "Bitcoin rises in Q4" doesn't mean Q4 causes it
- Look for confounding variables and alternative explanations

### Gambler's Fallacy
- Believing past random events affect future ones
- "It's dropped 5 days in a row, so it must go up tomorrow"
- Each event is independent (in random processes)
- Markets are not purely random, but this fallacy still applies

## Behavioral Finance

### Prospect Theory
- People evaluate outcomes relative to a reference point (not absolute value)
- Losses loom larger than gains (loss aversion)
- Risk-seeking with losses: people gamble to avoid realizing losses
- Risk-averse with gains: people take sure profits over larger uncertain gains
- Explains why investors sell winners and hold losers

### Mental Accounting
- Treating money differently based on its source or intended use
- "House money effect": more willing to risk profits than original capital
- "Airdrop money doesn't count" — but it has the same value
- Mitigation: treat all money as fungible, evaluate total portfolio

### Disposition Effect
- Selling winners too quickly and holding losers too long
- Driven by loss aversion and desire to realize gains
- Opposite of the profitable strategy (let winners run, cut losers)
- Mitigation: use systematic rules (stop-losses, take-profit levels)

### Narrative Fallacy
- Constructing stories to explain random events
- "The market dropped because of [retroactive explanation]"
- We need narratives to make sense of complexity, but they can mislead
- Mitigation: focus on data and probabilities, not stories

## Debiasing Techniques

### Checklists
- Pre-made list of criteria to evaluate before every decision
- Prevents emotional decisions and ensures thorough analysis
- Investment checklist: fundamentals, risk assessment, position sizing
- Forces consistency across decisions

### Devil's Advocate
- Assign someone (or yourself) to argue against the proposed action
- Forces consideration of opposing evidence
- Red team / blue team exercises
- Especially valuable for group decisions

### Base Rate Thinking
- Start with the general probability (base rate) before adjusting
- "What percentage of new tokens succeed?" (very low base rate)
- Then adjust for specific information about this token
- Prevents over-weighting of specific information

### Decision Journal
- Record each decision: the reasoning, expected outcome, confidence level
- Review periodically to identify patterns and biases
- Separates decision quality from outcome quality
- Builds self-awareness about your thinking patterns

### Cooling-Off Period
- Delay important decisions by a set time (24 hours, 1 week)
- Emotional intensity fades, rational thinking increases
- "Sleep on it" is genuinely good advice
- Set a rule: no impulsive trades above a certain size

## Group Decision Pitfalls

### Groupthink
- Group prioritizes consensus over critical evaluation
- Dissenting opinions are suppressed or self-censored
- Leads to poor decisions with false confidence
- Prevention: encourage dissent, use anonymous feedback, rotate devil's advocate

### Information Cascade
- People follow the actions of others, ignoring their own information
- "If three people before me bought, it must be good"
- Can create bubbles and crashes
- Prevention: make independent assessments before seeing others' decisions

### Social Proof
- Using others' behavior as a guide for your own
- "10,000 holders can't be wrong" (yes, they can)
- More powerful when uncertain or when the group seems similar to you
- Prevention: evaluate independently, recognize when you're following

## Metacognition

### Thinking About Thinking
- Awareness of your own cognitive processes
- Recognize when biases are influencing your judgment
- Ask: "Why do I believe this? What evidence would change my mind?"
- Intellectual humility: acknowledging the limits of your knowledge

### Calibration
- How well your confidence matches your accuracy
- If you're 90% confident and right 90% of the time, you're well-calibrated
- Most people are overconfident (90% confident but right 70% of the time)
- Practice with prediction exercises to improve calibration

### Developing Better Judgment
- Seek diverse perspectives and information sources
- Update beliefs incrementally as new evidence appears (Bayesian thinking)
- Distinguish between decisions and outcomes (good decisions can have bad outcomes)
- Focus on process over results in the long run
- Cultivate curiosity and a willingness to be wrong
