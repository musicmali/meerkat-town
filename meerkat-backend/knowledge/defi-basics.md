# DeFi (Decentralized Finance) Basics

DeFi refers to financial services built on blockchain technology that operate without traditional intermediaries like banks.

## Core Concepts

### Smart Contracts
- Self-executing code that runs on the blockchain
- Automatically enforce rules and execute transactions
- Cannot be changed once deployed (immutable)
- Enable trustless financial services

### Liquidity
- Liquidity refers to how easily an asset can be traded
- High liquidity = easy to buy/sell without affecting price
- Low liquidity = price impact when trading
- Liquidity is essential for DeFi protocols to function

### TVL (Total Value Locked)
- Measures the total amount of assets deposited in a DeFi protocol
- Higher TVL generally indicates more trust and adoption
- Used to compare and rank DeFi protocols
- Can be measured in USD or native tokens

## Types of DeFi Protocols

### Decentralized Exchanges (DEXs)
- Allow trading tokens without a centralized exchange
- Use Automated Market Makers (AMMs) instead of order books
- Popular DEXs: Uniswap, SushiSwap, Aerodrome (on Base)
- Users provide liquidity and earn trading fees

### Lending Protocols
- Borrow and lend crypto assets
- Earn interest by supplying assets
- Pay interest when borrowing
- Popular protocols: Aave, Compound, MakerDAO
- Use overcollateralization to manage risk

### Yield Farming
- Strategy to maximize returns on crypto assets
- Move assets between protocols to find best yields
- Can involve multiple steps: stake, provide liquidity, borrow
- Higher yields often come with higher risks

### Stablecoins
- Cryptocurrencies designed to maintain stable value
- Usually pegged to USD (1 token = $1)
- Types: Fiat-backed (USDC, USDT), Crypto-backed (DAI), Algorithmic
- Essential for DeFi as they provide stability

## Key DeFi Terms

### APY (Annual Percentage Yield)
- The real rate of return including compound interest
- Higher APY = better returns (but also potentially higher risk)
- Variable rates change based on supply and demand

### APR (Annual Percentage Rate)
- Simple interest rate without compounding
- APY is usually higher than APR for same investment
- Many DeFi protocols display both

### Impermanent Loss
- Risk when providing liquidity to AMMs
- Occurs when token prices change from when you deposited
- Called "impermanent" because it can reverse if prices return
- Important to understand before providing liquidity

### Slippage
- Difference between expected and actual trade price
- Occurs in low liquidity pools or large trades
- Set slippage tolerance to protect your trades
- Typical setting: 0.5% - 3%

### Gas Fees
- Transaction fees paid to blockchain validators
- On Ethereum: can be expensive ($5-$100+)
- On L2s like Base: much cheaper ($0.001-$0.10)
- Always check gas before confirming transactions

## DeFi Risks

### Smart Contract Risk
- Bugs in code can lead to loss of funds
- Look for audited protocols
- Check if protocol has bug bounty program

### Rug Pulls
- Developers abandon project and take user funds
- More common with new, unverified projects
- Research team and check if contracts are verified

### Oracle Manipulation
- Attackers manipulate price feeds
- Can cause liquidations or drain protocols
- Top protocols use multiple oracle sources

### Market Risk
- Crypto prices are volatile
- Collateral can lose value quickly
- Liquidation can occur if collateral ratio drops

## Best Practices

1. **Start Small**: Test with small amounts first
2. **Research**: Understand the protocol before using it
3. **Check Audits**: Use audited protocols when possible
4. **Diversify**: Don't put all funds in one protocol
5. **Monitor Positions**: Check your positions regularly
6. **Use Hardware Wallet**: For large amounts
7. **Understand Risks**: Know what can go wrong
