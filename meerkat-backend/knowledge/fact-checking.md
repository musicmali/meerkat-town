# Fact-Checking and Media Literacy

Fact-checking is the process of verifying claims, statements, and information for accuracy. In an era of widespread misinformation, media literacy and critical evaluation skills are essential for making informed decisions.

## Fact-Checking Methodology

### The Verification Process
1. **Identify the claim**: what specific assertion is being made?
2. **Find the original source**: trace the claim back to its origin
3. **Evaluate the source**: is it credible, authoritative, and transparent?
4. **Check multiple sources**: does independent reporting confirm the claim?
5. **Assess the evidence**: is it sufficient, relevant, and current?
6. **Reach a conclusion**: confirmed, false, misleading, or unverifiable

### Source Verification
- **Primary sources**: original documents, data, firsthand accounts
- **Secondary sources**: reports and analysis based on primary sources
- Peer-reviewed research carries more weight than opinion pieces
- Official records (government data, court filings) are strong evidence
- Always check the date — old data may no longer be accurate

### Lateral Reading
- Don't just read what a source says about itself
- Open multiple tabs and see what other sources say about it
- Check the source's reputation, funding, and potential biases
- Professional fact-checkers spend more time reading laterally than vertically
- Wikipedia's references section can point to authoritative sources

## Identifying Misinformation

### Types of Misinformation
- **Misinformation**: false information shared without intent to deceive
- **Disinformation**: false information deliberately created to deceive
- **Malinformation**: true information shared to cause harm (out of context)
- **Satire/parody**: not intended to deceive but can be mistaken as real

### Common Misinformation Patterns
- **Cherry-picking**: selecting only data that supports a narrative
- **False context**: real information presented in a misleading way
- **Manipulated content**: altered images, edited quotes, doctored data
- **Fabricated content**: entirely invented stories or documents
- **Misleading headlines**: clickbait that doesn't match the article content
- **Imposter content**: fake accounts impersonating credible sources

### Red Flags
- Emotional language designed to provoke outrage or fear
- No named sources or "according to experts" without specifics
- Claims that no mainstream media will report (conspiracy framing)
- Too-good-to-be-true promises or returns
- Urgency pressure ("share before it gets taken down")
- Single-source claims not corroborated elsewhere

## Crypto-Specific Misinformation

### Common Crypto False Claims
- Fake partnership announcements to pump token prices
- Fabricated exchange listing news
- Misleading "audit" claims (partial audits, outdated audits)
- Inflated TVL or user metrics through wash trading
- Fake endorsements from celebrities or influencers
- Doctored screenshots of profits or returns

### Verification for Crypto Claims
- Check official project channels (website, verified social accounts)
- Verify smart contracts on block explorers
- Cross-reference TVL data on DeFiLlama, DeBank
- Check audit reports on the auditor's website, not just the project's claim
- Verify team identities through LinkedIn, past projects, on-chain history
- Use on-chain analytics (Nansen, Arkham) to verify activity claims

## Deepfakes and AI-Generated Content

### Types of AI-Generated Fakes
- **Deepfake video**: face-swapped or lip-synced videos of real people
- **Voice cloning**: synthetic audio mimicking someone's voice
- **AI-generated text**: articles, reviews, or social posts by language models
- **AI-generated images**: photorealistic fake images (Midjourney, DALL-E)
- **Synthetic profiles**: fake personas with AI-generated photos and bios

### Detection Approaches
- Look for visual artifacts: unnatural blinking, inconsistent lighting, warped edges
- Audio analysis: unnatural pauses, metallic quality, inconsistent background noise
- Text patterns: repetitive structure, generic phrasing, factual errors
- Reverse image search to find the original or flag AI-generated images
- Metadata analysis: check EXIF data, creation tools
- AI detection tools (imperfect but improving): GPTZero, Originality.ai

### Healthy Skepticism
- Assume viral content may be manipulated until verified
- "Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence"
- Just because something looks real doesn't mean it is
- Verify before sharing, especially if emotionally provocative

## Statistical Misuse

### Common Statistical Tricks
- **Misleading graphs**: truncated Y-axis, cherry-picked time range
- **Correlation ≠ Causation**: two things happening together doesn't mean one causes the other
- **Small sample sizes**: drawing broad conclusions from limited data
- **Survivorship bias**: only looking at winners, ignoring failures
- **Relative vs absolute numbers**: "50% increase" could mean 2 to 3 (small absolute change)
- **Averages hiding distribution**: mean vs median can tell very different stories

### Evaluating Statistical Claims
- What is the sample size and how was data collected?
- Is the comparison fair (apples to apples)?
- What's the confidence interval or margin of error?
- Could there be confounding variables?
- Does the conclusion follow from the data?
- Is the data source credible and methodology transparent?

## Bias in News Sources

### Types of Media Bias
- **Selection bias**: what stories are covered (and what's ignored)
- **Framing bias**: how stories are presented (word choice, emphasis)
- **Confirmation bias**: readers gravitate toward agreeable sources
- **Ownership bias**: media owner interests influence coverage
- **Sensationalism**: exaggerating for clicks and engagement

### Evaluating News Sources
- Check media bias ratings (AllSides, Ad Fontes Media)
- Read the same story from multiple outlets
- Distinguish between news reporting and opinion/editorial
- Check if the outlet corrects errors transparently
- Follow journalists, not just outlets (individual track records matter)

## Verification Tools and Resources

### Fact-Checking Organizations
- Snopes: general fact-checking since 1994

- **Wayback Machine**: view archived versions of web pages
- **CrowdTangle / BuzzSumo**: track how content spreads on social media
- **InVID / WeVerify**: video verification toolkit
- **Exif viewers**: check image metadata (camera, date, location)

### Blockchain-Specific Tools

- DeFiLlama: independent TVL and protocol metrics
- Token Sniffer: check for common token scam patterns
- Rugdoc: DeFi security reviews
- CoinGecko / CoinMarketCap: verify token data and market metrics

## Media Literacy Best Practices

### Critical Consumption
- Question everything, especially if it confirms your existing beliefs
- Consider who benefits from you believing this information
- Check the date of information before citing it
- Be wary of anonymous sources and unverified claims
- Slow down: accuracy matters more than being first

### Responsible Sharing
- Verify before sharing, especially emotional or shocking content
- Add context when sharing complex information
- Correct yourself publicly if you share something that turns out to be wrong
- Don't amplify misinformation even to debunk it (the "truth sandwich" approach)
- Be especially careful during breaking news (early reports are often wrong)

### Building Verification Habits
- Develop a personal checklist for evaluating claims
- Follow diverse information sources across perspectives
- Practice lateral reading regularly
- Teach others media literacy skills
- Stay updated on new misinformation tactics and tools
