# Financial Analysis

Financial analysis encompasses methods for evaluating assets, managing risk, and making informed investment decisions. In crypto markets, it combines traditional finance techniques with on-chain analytics unique to blockchain.

## Technical Analysis

### Candlestick Charts
- Each candle shows open, high, low, and close prices for a time period
- Green/white candle: price closed higher than it opened (bullish)
- Red/black candle: price closed lower than it opened (bearish)
- Wicks show the high and low extremes
- Common patterns: doji (indecision), hammer (reversal), engulfing (momentum shift)

### Support and Resistance
- Support: price level where buying pressure prevents further decline
- Resistance: price level where selling pressure prevents further rise
- Broken resistance often becomes new support (and vice versa)
- Multiple touches increase the significance of a level
- Round numbers often act as psychological support/resistance

### Moving Averages
- **SMA (Simple Moving Average)**: average price over N periods
- **EMA (Exponential Moving Average)**: weighted toward recent prices
- Common periods: 20-day (short), 50-day (medium), 200-day (long)
- Golden cross: short MA crosses above long MA (bullish)
- Death cross: short MA crosses below long MA (bearish)
- Price above 200 MA generally considered bullish trend

### RSI (Relative Strength Index)
- Momentum oscillator from 0 to 100
- Above 70: overbought (potential reversal down)
- Below 30: oversold (potential reversal up)
- Divergence: price makes new high but RSI doesn't (weakening momentum)
- Default period: 14 candles

### MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence)
- MACD line: 12 EMA minus 26 EMA
- Signal line: 9 EMA of the MACD line
- Histogram: difference between MACD and signal line
- Bullish: MACD crosses above signal line
- Bearish: MACD crosses below signal line
- Useful for identifying trend direction and momentum

### Bollinger Bands
- Middle band: 20-period SMA
- Upper band: SMA + 2 standard deviations
- Lower band: SMA - 2 standard deviations
- Price near upper band: potentially overbought
- Price near lower band: potentially oversold
- Bands squeeze before big moves (low volatility precedes high volatility)

### Volume Analysis
- Volume confirms price movements
- Rising price + rising volume = strong trend
- Rising price + falling volume = weak trend (potential reversal)
- Volume spikes at support/resistance indicate significant levels
- On Balance Volume (OBV): cumulative volume indicator

## Fundamental Analysis for Tokens

### Token Metrics
- **Market Cap**: price x circulating supply (relative valuation)
- **Fully Diluted Valuation (FDV)**: price x total supply (future dilution risk)
- **Circulating Supply**: tokens currently available for trading
- **Total Supply vs Max Supply**: understand inflation/deflation mechanics
- FDV >> Market Cap indicates significant future token unlocks

### Token Unlock Schedules
- Vesting: tokens released over time (team, investors, treasury)
- Cliff: initial period before any tokens unlock
- Linear unlock: steady release over time
- Large unlocks create sell pressure
- Check unlock schedules on Token Unlocks, CryptoRank, or project docs

### Revenue and Earnings
- Protocol revenue: fees generated by the protocol
- Token holder revenue: fees distributed to token holders
- Price-to-earnings (P/E): market cap divided by annualized revenue
- Real yield: revenue distributed to stakers vs. token emissions
- Protocols with real revenue are fundamentally stronger

### Tokenomics Analysis
- Supply schedule: inflationary or deflationary?
- Burn mechanisms (e.g., ETH EIP-1559, BNB quarterly burn)
- Staking economics: rewards, lock-up periods
- Governance rights and voting power
- Treasury size and spending rate

## On-Chain Analytics

### Wallet and Address Analysis
- **Whale tracking**: monitor large holder movements
- **Exchange flows**: tokens moving to/from exchanges (sell/buy signals)
- **Active addresses**: daily unique addresses interacting (network health)
- **New addresses**: growth in new users
- Tools: Nansen, Arkham, Dune Analytics, Glassnode

### DeFi-Specific Metrics
- **TVL (Total Value Locked)**: assets deposited in protocol
- **TVL changes**: declining TVL may indicate loss of confidence
- **Protocol revenue**: fees earned by the protocol
- **User count**: daily/monthly active users
- **Transaction count**: protocol usage activity

### On-Chain Signals
- **NVT Ratio** (Network Value to Transactions): market cap / daily transaction volume
- **MVRV** (Market Value to Realized Value): compares market price to average acquisition price
- **Supply in profit**: percentage of supply held at a profit (sentiment indicator)
- **Stablecoin flows**: large stablecoin inflows to exchanges may signal buying
- **Miner/validator activity**: selling patterns of block producers

## Risk Management

### Position Sizing
- Never risk more than 1-5% of portfolio on a single trade
- Kelly Criterion: optimal bet size based on edge and odds
- Scale into positions gradually rather than all at once
- Size inversely proportional to conviction uncertainty

### Stop-Loss Strategies
- Fixed percentage: sell if price drops X% from entry
- Technical: stop below key support level
- Trailing stop: moves up with price, locks in profits
- Time-based: exit if thesis hasn't played out within timeframe
- Mental vs. on-chain stops (DEX limit orders, DeFi automation)

### Diversification
- Across asset types: BTC, ETH, altcoins, stablecoins
- Across sectors: DeFi, NFTs, L1s, L2s, infrastructure
- Across chains: Ethereum, Base, Solana, etc.
- Correlation awareness: many crypto assets move together
- Stablecoin allocation for opportunities and risk reduction

### Risk Assessment Checklist
- Is the smart contract audited? By whom?
- How long has the protocol been live?
- Is the team public (doxxed) or anonymous?
- What is the TVL trend (growing or declining)?
- Are there token unlock events approaching?
- How concentrated is token ownership?
- Is there a bug bounty program?
- What happens if a dependency (oracle, bridge) fails?

## Portfolio Theory

### Modern Portfolio Theory Basics
- **Sharpe Ratio**: (return - risk-free rate) / standard deviation
- Higher Sharpe ratio = better risk-adjusted returns
- **Correlation**: how assets move relative to each other
- Low correlation between assets improves portfolio efficiency
- Diversification reduces unsystematic risk

### Portfolio Construction
- Core holdings: BTC, ETH (lower risk, established)
- Satellite positions: altcoins, DeFi tokens (higher risk/reward)
- Rebalancing: periodically adjust to target allocations
- Dollar-cost averaging (DCA): invest fixed amounts at regular intervals
- Avoid over-concentration in any single asset

## Yield Strategy Analysis

### Types of Yield
- **Real yield**: derived from actual protocol revenue (fees, interest)
- **Incentivized yield**: paid in protocol tokens (may be unsustainable)
- **Staking yield**: rewards for securing the network
- **LP yield**: trading fees from providing liquidity
- Always ask: where is the yield coming from?

### Sustainability Assessment
- High APY (>100%) is usually unsustainable long-term
- Check if yield comes from real usage or token emissions
- Token emission-based yield dilutes holders when sold
- Look at historical APY trends (declining = emissions diminishing)
- Compare to risk-free alternatives (T-bills, stablecoin lending)

## Macro Indicators

### Crypto-Relevant Macro Factors
- **Interest rates**: higher rates reduce appetite for risk assets
- **Dollar strength (DXY)**: strong dollar often correlates with weak crypto
- **Inflation data (CPI)**: impacts Fed policy and market sentiment
- **Quantitative easing/tightening**: liquidity drives crypto cycles
- **Regulatory news**: SEC actions, legislation, global regulations

### Market Cycle Awareness
- Bull markets: expanding valuations, high risk appetite, leverage increases
- Bear markets: contracting valuations, capitulation, focus on fundamentals
- Accumulation phase: smart money buys while sentiment is low
- Distribution phase: smart money sells into retail euphoria
- Bitcoin halving cycles have historically correlated with bull runs
