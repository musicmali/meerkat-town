# Photography Fundamentals

## The Exposure Triangle

### Aperture (f-stop)
Controls how much light enters through the lens.
- Lower f-number = wider opening = more light
- f/1.4, f/2, f/2.8 = wide aperture (shallow depth of field)
- f/8, f/11, f/16 = narrow aperture (deep depth of field)
- Affects depth of field (background blur)
- Sweet spot: Usually f/5.6-f/8 for sharpness

### Shutter Speed
How long the sensor is exposed to light.
- Fast (1/1000s+): Freeze action, less light
- Medium (1/125s): General handheld shooting
- Slow (1/30s and below): Motion blur, tripod needed
- Long exposure (seconds): Light trails, smooth water
- Rule: Minimum 1/(focal length) for sharp handheld

### ISO
Sensor sensitivity to light.
- Low ISO (100-400): Clean images, best quality
- Medium ISO (800-1600): Indoor, low light
- High ISO (3200+): Very dark, introduces noise
- Native ISO: Sensor's base sensitivity (usually 100)
- Auto ISO: Camera adjusts automatically

## Camera Modes

### Manual (M)
- Full control of all settings
- Best for consistent lighting
- Learning tool

### Aperture Priority (A/Av)
- You set aperture, camera sets shutter
- Great for portraits (control DoF)
- Most versatile mode

### Shutter Priority (S/Tv)
- You set shutter, camera sets aperture
- Action/sports photography
- Motion blur control

### Program (P)
- Camera sets both, you can shift
- Quick shooting

## Composition

### Rule of Thirds
- Divide frame into 3x3 grid
- Place subjects on intersections
- Creates visual interest

### Leading Lines
- Use lines to guide the eye
- Roads, fences, architecture
- Lead to subject or through frame

### Framing
- Use foreground elements as frame
- Windows, doorways, branches
- Adds depth and context

### Symmetry and Patterns
- Balanced compositions
- Reflections
- Repeating elements
- Can break symmetry for tension

### Negative Space
- Empty space around subject
- Creates breathing room
- Emphasizes subject

### Depth and Layers
- Foreground, middle ground, background
- Creates three-dimensional feel
- Guides viewer through image

## Lighting

### Natural Light
- Golden hour: Shortly after sunrise/before sunset
- Blue hour: Just before sunrise/after sunset
- Overcast: Soft, diffused light
- Midday: Harsh shadows (avoid or use fill)

### Direction of Light
- Front lighting: Flat, even
- Side lighting: Texture, drama
- Back lighting: Silhouettes, rim light
- Top lighting: Harsh shadows

### Quality of Light
- Hard light: Direct source, sharp shadows
- Soft light: Diffused, gentle shadows
- Fill light: Reduces shadow contrast
- Reflectors: Bounce light into shadows

### Artificial Lighting
- Flash/speedlight: Portable, versatile
- Continuous lights: What you see is what you get
- Softboxes: Large, soft light source
- Umbrellas: Broad, soft light
- Ring lights: Even facial lighting

## Camera Gear

### Camera Types
- DSLR: Mirror-based, optical viewfinder
- Mirrorless: Electronic viewfinder, compact
- Medium format: Larger sensor, highest quality
- Compact: All-in-one, convenience
- Smartphone: Always with you

### Lenses
- Prime: Fixed focal length, sharper, faster
- Zoom: Variable focal length, versatile
- Wide angle (10-35mm): Landscapes, architecture
- Standard (35-70mm): Everyday, portraits
- Telephoto (70-200mm+): Sports, wildlife, portraits
- Macro: Extreme close-ups

### Essential Accessories
- Tripod: Stability, long exposures
- Filters: ND (reduce light), polarizer (reduce glare)
- Memory cards: Fast, reliable
- Extra batteries: Always have spares
- Camera bag: Protection and organization

## Genres of Photography

### Portrait Photography
- Focus on eyes
- Flattering angles
- Background separation (wide aperture)
- Catch lights in eyes
- Direct or natural expressions

### Landscape Photography
- Deep depth of field (f/8-f/16)
- Tripod for sharpness
- Golden/blue hour light
- Foreground interest
- Weather adds drama

### Street Photography
- Candid moments
- Fast reactions
- Respect and ethics
- Zone focusing
- Unobtrusive approach

### Product Photography
- Clean backgrounds
- Proper lighting setup
- Multiple angles
- Detail shots
- Color accuracy

### Wildlife Photography
- Long lenses
- Patience
- Knowledge of behavior
- Early morning/late evening
- Ethical distance

## Post-Processing

### Basic Adjustments
- Exposure and contrast
- White balance
- Highlights and shadows
- Blacks and whites
- Clarity and vibrance

### Editing Software
- Adobe Lightroom: Industry standard
- Capture One: Professional alternative
- DxO PhotoLab: Excellent noise reduction
- Darktable: Free, open source
- Snapseed: Mobile editing

### Workflow
1. Import and backup
2. Cull and select
3. Basic corrections
4. Creative editing
5. Export for purpose
6. Archive and organize

### File Formats
- RAW: Unprocessed, maximum flexibility
- JPEG: Compressed, ready to share
- TIFF: Lossless, large files
- DNG: Universal RAW format

## Technical Tips

### Focus Techniques
- Single point AF: Precise control
- Continuous AF: Moving subjects
- Back button focus: Separate focus from shutter
- Manual focus: Ultimate control
- Focus peaking: Manual focus aid

### White Balance
- Auto: Usually works well
- Daylight: ~5500K
- Cloudy: ~6500K (warmer)
- Shade: ~7500K (warmer)
- Tungsten: ~3200K (cooler)
- Custom: Measured for accuracy

### Histogram
- Visual representation of exposure
- Left: Shadows, Right: Highlights
- Avoid clipping (hitting edges)
- Expose to the right (ETTR) for best quality
